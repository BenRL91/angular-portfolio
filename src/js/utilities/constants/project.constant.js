      detailedDescription: "Lifteri is built using React.js. It is an application for travelers. Driver's planning a trip can post their trip, tell potential riders how many seats are available in their car, and leave a description of the trip to help users get a feel for the trip they're planning. The beauty of Lifteri is in the price distribution. When a rider joins the trip, the price goes down. Not only that but the driver always pays 20% less than the rest of the passengers, everyone gets where they want to go, and everyone has a little bit more money when they get there. A win win!",
